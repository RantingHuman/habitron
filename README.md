# Habitron

Habitron is a habit tracking application partially inspired by [Loop](https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits), being built with React + TypeScript and Tauri 2.0. It is currently a work in progress, with the primary goal being exploration and learning, while also building something I'd use regularly on desktop and mobile. The current tech stack also includes:

- React Router
- Zustand
- TailwindCSS


## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- `src/`: This is where the main application code resides. It includes the React components, Zustand stores, utility functions etc.
- `src-tauri/`: This directory contains the configuration and build files for the Tauri application.

## Building and running the Project

TODO

```sh
npm i
npm run tauri dev
```
